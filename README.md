# Some scripts to ease my experience with a Dualshock 4 V1

At moment there's an udev rule and service to start/stop [evdevhook](https://github.com/v1993/evdevhook) on controller connection/disconnection and some script to make it easy to start/stop [xboxdrv](https://xboxdrv.gitlab.io/) with ds4 v1, planning to add some fancy led control scripts and polish everything a little more.

I ~stole ideas~ took inspiration from:
